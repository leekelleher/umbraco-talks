### The Session

Carlsberg had a problem, how could they deliver a single multi-lingual CMS solution for over 500 different brands?

Step up Umbrella and Umbraco-as-a-Service!

In this session, you will hear how Lee and the Umbrella team delivered a simple, yet highly configurable solution for the Carlsberg Group, all running on the Umbraco-as-a-Service platform.

From developing a single codebase to build a reusable framework, to the extensibility of modular design integrating custom skinnable components.
